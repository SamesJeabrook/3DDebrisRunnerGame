# 3d Debris Runner

*This is my 3d Debris runner game created using three.js. This is a project that is a work in progress and is what I have learnt from several other tutorials on three.js*


## Future improvements

* Addition of Sockets to enable mobile control of game.
* Enable scoring system and keep scores on database.
* Skin game to look more appealing rather than just 3d blocks
